This is the deanstream. It does not work on mobile. sorry guys. working on it.

Come here to watch Dean sleep, or wake him up!

Dean ALSO needs to delete the test webms and put the real files in it.

Be aware the "requirements.txt" file is rather bloated, you do not need
the database stuff for the current build. there are plans to incorperate
one in the future however.

jQuery, Flask, and some sleep! (also some twitter bootstrap!)
