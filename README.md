This is the deanstream. It does not work on mobile. sorry guys. working on it.

broke jquery, added mp4 videos.

this is not ready for master branch yet.

CHANGE THE VIDEO ELEMENT TO USE SOURCE TAGS!

check the w3 schools for def on how!

Come here to watch Dean sleep, or wake him up!

Dean ALSO needs to delete the test webms and put the real files in it.

Be aware the "requirements.txt" file is rather bloated, you do not need
the database stuff for the current build. there are plans to incorperate
one in the future however.

jQuery, Flask, and some sleep! (also some twitter bootstrap!)
