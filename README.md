This is the deanstream. 

Come here to watch Dean sleep, or wake him up!

Dean ALSO needs to delete the test webms and put the real files in it.

decision made: originally routes provided a random file from the
directory. this is a bad idea because it is very likely it will provide
the same link that the web page already has, instead I am going to just
pass json with all videos in the folder and use javascript to choose one
that is not already on the page...
