this branch will replace the master eventually!

update! there is a light!

So here is the deal,
use local memory to store the primary id from the video
check that id before we write the html.

the jquery needs to be entirely redone for this.
but it seems like the right thing todo.
avoid the while loop.
another excuse to write javascript!

Now with 0.1 less SQLALCHEMY! here comes the database mess! make sure
to use sqlalchemy 0.7.10! there is an error with .8!

This is the deanstream. It does not work on mobile. sorry guys. working on it.

jQuery is working but the html does not, replacing the <source> tag does
nothing for the browser. replace the attr() with an html().

this is not ready for master branch yet.

Come here to watch Dean sleep, or wake him up!

Be aware the "requirements.txt" file is rather bloated, but for this
branch you do need sqlalchemy and sqlite3

jQuery, Flask, and some sleep! (also some twitter bootstrap!)
